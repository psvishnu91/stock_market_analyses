# stock_market_analyses
Analyse the stock market with python. Heavily inspired by sentdex [pythonprogramming.net] (https://pythonprogramming.net/getting-stock-prices-python-programming-for-finance/).

Will mostly contain notebooks which use sentdex's videos as a starting point. Perhaps the strongest difference is that I employ `plotly` for plotting whereas sentdex uses `matplotlib`.
