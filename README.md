# stock_market_analyses

### Checkout the notebook renders in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/psvishnu91/stock_market_analyses/tree/master/).
Analyse the stock market with python. Heavily inspired by @sentdex's [Python for Finance](https://pythonprogramming.net/getting-stock-prices-python-programming-for-finance/).

Will mostly contain notebooks which use @sentdex's videos as a starting point. Perhaps the strongest difference is that I employ `plotly` for plotting whereas sentdex uses `matplotlib`.
